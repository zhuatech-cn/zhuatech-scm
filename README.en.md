# ZhuaTech Supply Chain Management

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for supply chain, procurement, order, warehouse, and logistics operations.

ZhuaTech Supply Chain Management provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for supply chain, procurement, order, warehouse, and logistics operations. It is designed for procurement, planning, warehouse, logistics, supplier, and operations teams, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise supply chain management, self-hosted supply chain management, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Solution Overview

- **Primary users:** Procurement, planning, warehouse, logistics, supplier, and operations teams.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Business Coverage

- **User** — Manage user with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Supplier** — Coordinate supplier through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Material** — Track material metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Demand Plan** — Preserve demand plan evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Purchase Order** — Expose purchase order in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Supply Alert** — Connect supply alert to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Implementation Stack

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `deploy/` — deployment and operations resources

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
